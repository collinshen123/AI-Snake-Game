# AI-Snake-Game - ML Rienforcement Learning project with Pytorch and Pygame

This is a python reinforcement learning project that uses Pytorch and Pygame to train an AI to play the classic snake game. The AI is trained using a Deep Q Network (DQN) and is able to achieve a score of 100+ after 1000 rounds of training.

The Snake game is built from scratch using Pygame and the AI is built using Pytorch. 
An agent is created to automate the game. Using a reinforcmement learning ML model, the agent is rewareded for eating food and penalized for dying.
The AI's learning progress is plotted below:
